# Java Codespaces Starter for KVS

Change the title and enter the lab instructions here. You can leave the codespaces instructions below so your crew has them to reference.

## Codespaces Instructions

To run your code, right click on a Java file with a `main` method and click `Run Java`. Your code will build and run in the terminal in the bottom of the window. 

Some labs will prompt you for information so that you can test your code. 

If your code does not build you will see errors in the terminal instead of the output you expected. 

### Turning in Code

On the left side of the window is the Git tab - it looks like a flow chart with 3 open circles and may also have a label of how many files you've updated since opening your project. Click that. 

You'll see a list of changed files and a message box. Enter a message explaining what you did on this commit. It can be anything, but there does need to be a message.

Then click on the down arrow next to `Commit` and select `Commit and Sync`. This will push your code back to your GitHub repository. 

For most labs that push will trigger your code to be autograded. You can click back to your repository to see the results. You should see either a green checkbox or a red x depending on whether your code passed the tests. 

### Special Folders

There are folders in this project starting with a period - `.devcontainer`, `.github` and `.vscode`. You should not modify anything in these folders. Modifying files in these folders could affect how your assignments are graded, and by extension your grades.
